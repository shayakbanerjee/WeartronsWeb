    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="#">What is Run-n-Read?</a>
          <p>As the name suggests, itâ€™s a device that helps you keep reading your favorite book without letting your cardio time get in the way. If youâ€™ve ever taken up that unputdownable book which forced you to skip your exercise, or youâ€™ve spent your treadmill time wondering about what happens in the next chapter, youâ€™ll know what weâ€™re talking about.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="#">Will I go dizzy trying to keep up with moving text?</a>
          <p>Thatâ€™s the beauty of it â€?the text keeps up with you, not the other way around. Our intelligent algorithms utilize a fast screen refresh rate of 60 frames per second (movies are at only 24 frames per sec) to provide a seamless reading experience akin to being at rest.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="#">Why not Google glass?</a>
          <p>Different technology and application! Google Glass is meant to read only few lines of content at a time such as directions or text messages. It displays the content above the user's right eye. Thatâ€™s normally not where you would keep your book. </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="#">Why not a mobile app that uses the front facing camera?</a>
          <p>Yes, we tried that and quickly gave up for many reasons. The experience is much better with hardware. Additional features like remote flipping and fitness tracker are not possible. Also, the battery drains significantly due to the complex algorithms required to deal with different conditions â€?dim lights, face not in full view, and crowd in subways. You probably have enough trouble keeping that device charged anyway.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="#">Is it safe?</a>
          <p>Absolutely! Run-n-Read emits less than 1/10,000th the same amount of radiation as a cell phone and only a small fraction of what we humans get from using a Bluetooth headset. Our devices will ship FCC certified and well within the specifications followed by any other product considered to be safe.</p>

          <p>No. Well, not at this point in time. However, we have discussions in flight with multiple gyms and equipment manufacturers to make this a reality. Also, we are still figuring out how to hack a TVâ€?/p>

          <p>Itâ€™s simple. We provide the device and a mobile application. You load up your current reading material on your favorite mobile device using our free app and clip on the device to your shirt/headband. Tap on the Run-n-Read option, and hey presto! The text will move in sync with your head so you never lose focus â€?on the words, or your workout.</p>

          <p>Ah, you are not alone. Run-n-Read is an experience product â€?you will have to try it on to appreciate its effectiveness! Till then, this might help. We have had tested with many people on different machines and everyone had that â€œahaâ€?moment!</p>

          <p>Samsung S4 uses front-facing camera to follow a user's eye movements. This feature is primarily used to interact with the phone such as navigation and pausing/playing a video. To enable run-n-read, S4 camera should be able to follow the eyes (or head) accurately and in real time translate it to the text movement.</p>

          <p>If youâ€™re like us, and prefer to absorb and visualize a story through text/images, youâ€™ll know that audio canâ€™t provide the same experience. Based on our research, many people love to read while exercising, but use audio books because they do not have a choice. Now, they do. Besides, have you tried turning a few pages forward or backward in audio? Or flipping through pages to read highlights?</p>

          <p>Our device accounts for your height and weight (user input) along with the number of steps taken in a given time to calculate the calories burned. The calorie calculation is performed every few seconds to accurately capture the difference in pace during the total time period.</p>
